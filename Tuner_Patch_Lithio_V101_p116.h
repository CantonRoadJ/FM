*  Version:             1.01 - p01.16
*
* Usage:
*   Compile and link this C-file and declare in the source-file for required initialization transmissions the following:
*
* extern const size_t LutSize;
* extern const unsigned char * pLutBytes;
*
* extern const size_t PatchSize;
* extern const unsigned char * pPatchBytes;
*
* The source for required initialization transmissions should create the following set of I2C transmissions:
* 
* [ w 1C 0000 ]            script example:  S C8 1C 00 00 P
* [ w 1C 0074 ]            script example:  S C8 1C 00 74 P
* [ w 1B <pPatchBytes> ]   script example:  S C8 1B F0 00 .... P
*         PatchSize of pPatchBytes can be divided (on a 2 byte boundary) in separate transmissions all starting with command identifier 0x1B.
* [ w 1C 0000 ]            script example:  S C8 1C 00 00 P
* [ w 1C 0075 ]            script example:  S C8 1C 00 75 P
* [ w 1B <pLutBytes> ]     script example:  S C8 1B 40 13 .... P
*         LutSize of pLutBytes can be divided (on a 2 byte boundary) in separate transmissions all starting with command identifier 0x1B.
